# CRIV - Case Remover (after) Installation Validation
Another Google Chrome extension for Salesforce. When we go live, our Test Team performs IV test (Installation Validation). Few Cases on Production needs to be created in order to check if new release was deployed correctly. After things are tested, we need to do the cleanup - as MI atlas does not expose (technical) possibility to purge Case completely from database, we always had to execute anonymous Apex script. Thanks to this extension, we can perform that using nice UI.
